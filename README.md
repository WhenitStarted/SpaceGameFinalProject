The player can move in any direction and can shoot lasers. There are also enemy alien ships that can take down your life if they collide or shoot you. If you shoot a certain number of enemies then a barrier below will get built. Everytime an enemy collides with a barrier one of the barriers will be popped out. To win you need to make sure you get all the barriers before the enemy kills you or they break through your barrier. 

This game was made for a C++ class where we implemented things such as stacks/ques, Object Oriented programming, Linked Lists, Pointers, etc. 

To run the game one will need SFML installed, all the files or folders inside the main folder need to placed in one folder for the program to run. 

Screenshots of the game are shown below:
